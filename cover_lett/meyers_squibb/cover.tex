\opening{Dear Dat Nghiem,}

Oliver Nguyen referred me to you because I am interested in the field of discovering new
small molecules for cancer therapeutics and using computational chemistry to assist in
that regard. I met Oliver at the University of California, Irvine,
Alumni event in 2019 and we have kept in touch since.

Recently, I have successfully defended my doctorate work titled \textit{Developing
  the Theory of Dispersion Interactions for Biological Applications}. My activities
in research and mentorship have guided my interests in drug discovery. The collaboration
with experimentalists from the Vanderwall Lab hightlights my ability to develop a
useful model to understand the novel halogen-$\pi$ interaction between the chlorolissoclimide
and 80S ribosome. I have used this model to propose potential cancer drug candidates.

I hope to continue these interests in an industrial setting. Thank you so much for your
time and consideration.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
